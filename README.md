# 1KARPES_DAQ

Data acquisition software for the ultra low temperature ARPES system at the electronic
structure research laboratory at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
(KAIST).

## User guide

### Starting the software

1. Make sure that the HV rack switch is turned OFF.
2. Power on the DAQ PC (left) and log in with appropriate credentials.
3. Once the DAQ PC is on, power on the monitoring PC (right) and check if the network
   drive (D:) is connected.
4. On the monitoring PC, start the following programs from the desktop (order does not
   matter):
   - MG15
   - ü•∂ Temperature controller
   - üòá Motion controller
   - üéõÔ∏è F70H (recommended to be always running): see
     [here](#starting-the-f70h-helium-compressor-program)

   Check if each program is running correctly by looking at value updates.
5. Once the programs are running, double click on `Start Servers` in the desktop. In the
   window that appears, click the three `Start Server` buttons.
6. On the DAQ PC, start `SES.exe` from the desktop.
7. In SES, click on `Calibration -> Voltages...`. Close the voltage calibration window
   after making sure that the lens mode is angular and the pass energy is sufficiently
   low.
8. In SES, click on `DA30 -> Control Theta...` and close the control theta window that
   appears.
9. Double click on `Start DAQ` in the desktop. The system is now ready for data
   acquisition.

### Stopping the software

Stopping the software is a reverse process of starting it. Close each program in the
reverse order of starting them. Remember to not close the terminal window that appears
when starting some programs; they will close automatically when the main window of the
program is closed.

### Conducting scans

#### Setting up scans

The DAQ software serves as a front-end for the SES software. All scans *must* be started
with the `Start` button in the DAQ software, not SES. The user will not have to interact
with SES menu items directly.

The slit indicator in the GUI determines the analyzer slit information recorded in the
data file. Remember to set the slit indicator to the correct value when changing the
analyzer slit.

All attributes are recorded when the scan ends.

### Troubleshooting

#### Running scans without the DAQ software

SES grabs data attributes such as temperature and pressure from the user extension
library `UIExtension_Library.dll` ([source](https://github.com/kmnhan/SESExtension))
program when a scan ends. The user extension library requests data from the DAQ
software (Python) via a socket connection. If the DAQ program is not running, SES will
not be able to grab the data attributes, and will hang indefinitely upon scan
completion.

If this happens and for some reason the DAQ software cannot be started, the user can
remove the user extension library with the following steps:

1. Click on `Setup -> User Interfaces...` in SES.
2. Select `UIExtension_Library.dll` in the list and click `Delete`.
3. Click `Close` to close the window.

Now, you can run scans from the SES software without the DAQ software running. Note
that the data saved this way will not contain temperature, pressure, position, and
other attributes that are grabbed from the DAQ software.

#### Starting the F70H Helium compressor program

The F70H program (üéõÔ∏è) is used to monitor the helium compressor status and send
notifications through slack. The program is started by double clicking on the desktop
icon.

Upon starting the program, the user will be prompted to select a COM port. The Helium
compressor is connected via a RS-232 serial connection to a USB-to-serial multiport
adapter (4 ports), which is connected to a USB isolator and then to the monitoring PC.
The COM port numbers are assigned by Windows and is subject to change, but the 4 ports
of the multiport adapter are usually assigned to consecutive COM port numbers. In the
list of available COM ports, look for 4 consecutive COM port numbers. The largest COM
port number is the one assigned to the F70H, and the smallest COM port number is used
for the RGA. The two middle ports are unused. If this is ambiguous, power on the RGA and
check the COM port number assigned to it through the RGA software. Add 3 to this number
to get the COM port number assigned to the F70H.

Once a valid COM port is selected, the program will start. Check the alarm status and
make sure all indicators are showing üü¢.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Additional dependencies for each program are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file in
  each subdirectory under `src`

### Installation

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras --dev
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks by running `pre-commit install` in the root directory.

### Notes

- Builds must be trigerred manually from the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/kmnhan/1KARPES_DAQ/actions).
- When adding or modifying dependencies, use `uv` to manage them. Do not modify the
  `pyproject.toml` files manually.
